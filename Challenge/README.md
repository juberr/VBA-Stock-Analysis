# Project Overview

## Background

Steve's parents have invested a lot of their money into the DQ stock. Steve wants to analyze the performance of the DQ stock, along with similar stocks to track the health of his parent's investment. Steve will need the help of a VBA macro to create this analysis quickly!

## Purpose
While happy with the results of the workbook provided, Steve wants to do more research for his parents and include the entire stock market over the last few years. The original code must be refactored to perform the same function, but over any number of stocks.

# Results

Refactoring the code resulted in a much faster macro for Steve's workbook. By refactoring the macro to only loop through all the data one time, we have cut down the total running time down to about 20%.
